This is a collection of NUMA topologies that can be tested on any platform
thanks to QEMU.

Replace the contents of qemu.sh with whatever incantation works for you, the
default provided uses an arm64 target because that's clearly the superior
architecture.

Mostly meant to be run with CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y and 'sched_verbose'
(or 'sched_debug' for older kernels) on the cmdline.
